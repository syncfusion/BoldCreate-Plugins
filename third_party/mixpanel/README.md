# Mixpanel

BoldCreate plugin that connects agents to Mixpanel through the vendor's hosted [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server over streamable HTTP.

## MCP

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mixpanel": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.mixpanel.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Setup

No settings.

The first time the agent calls a tool, each member signs in to Mixpanel in the browser (OAuth). Tool calls run with that member's permissions.

This plugin targets the US endpoint (`https://mcp.mixpanel.com/mcp`). Mixpanel also runs EU (`mcp-eu.mixpanel.com`) and IN (`mcp-in.mixpanel.com`) endpoints; on another region, contact us for a site-specific build.
