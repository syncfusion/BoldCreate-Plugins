# Amplitude

BoldCreate plugin that connects agents to Amplitude through the vendor's hosted [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server over streamable HTTP.

Query Amplitude product analytics, charts, and experiments.

## Install

- **BoldCreate Connect:** open **Marketplace**, find **Amplitude**, and click **Install**.
- **Cursor:** add this repository as a team marketplace, then install **Amplitude**.
- **Claude Code:** `/plugin marketplace add syncfusion/BoldCreate-Plugins`, then `/plugin install amplitude@boldcreate-plugins`.

## MCP

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "amplitude": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.amplitude.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Setup

No settings.

The first time the agent calls a tool, each member signs in to Amplitude in the browser (OAuth). Tool calls run with that member's permissions. The vendor's repository does not state the auth mode for the hosted server, so confirm it against Amplitude's documentation before release.
