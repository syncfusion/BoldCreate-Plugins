# Changelog

All notable changes to this plugin will be documented here.

## 0.7.2 - 2026-11-13

- `SUPABASE_READ_ONLY` is back as a required setting with no default. You enter `true` or `false` at install. Because a value is required, the URL placeholder cannot be left unreplaced.
- README: added a link to Supabase's privacy policy.

## 0.7.1 - 2026-11-10

- Sign-in is now OAuth: each member signs in to their own account. The `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` settings are removed, and the personal access token stays an alternative. Read-only mode stays on by default.
- Added the 2 agent skills published in `supabase/agent-skills` (commit `c9be0e93`), copied unchanged, with Supabase's MIT licence in `skills/LICENSE`.
- README: added authentication, what the tools can do, write access, confirmations, rate limits and security notes.
- Recorded a live check of the hosted endpoint on 2026-11-10.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-10-26
