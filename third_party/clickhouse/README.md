# ClickHouse

BoldCreate plugin that connects agents to ClickHouse through the vendor's hosted [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server over streamable HTTP.

Connect AI assistants to ClickHouse Cloud: list databases and tables, inspect schemas, and run scoped, read-only SELECT queries.

## Install

- **BoldCreate Connect:** open **Marketplace**, find **ClickHouse**, and click **Install**.
- **Cursor:** add this repository as a team marketplace, then install **ClickHouse**.
- **Claude Code:** `/plugin marketplace add syncfusion/BoldCreate-Plugins`, then `/plugin install clickhouse@boldcreate-plugins`.

      "url": "https://mcp.clickhouse.cloud/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Setup

No settings.

The first time the agent calls a tool, each member signs in to ClickHouse in the browser (OAuth). Tool calls run with that member's permissions.
