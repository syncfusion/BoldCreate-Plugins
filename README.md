# Syncfusion BoldCreate Plugins

Syncfusion's BoldCreate plugins for BoldCreate Connect, Cursor and Claude Code. The repository holds three kinds of plugin, each in its own directory with its own manifests:

- **Syncfusion plugins** at the repository root, made of skills, agents and rules. `boldcreate-toolkit/` gives agents one software delivery lifecycle on any stack.
- **Syncfusion skill packs** under `syncfusion/`, one plugin per platform. Each is copied from Syncfusion's skill repository for that platform and teaches agents to build with Syncfusion components.
- **MCP plugins** under `third_party/`. Each connects agents to a vendor's remote [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server over streamable HTTP.
- **Community skill plugins** under `third_party/`. Each is a vendor's skills, copied as published, with the source commit recorded in `boldcreate.json`.

## Install

- **BoldCreate Connect:** open **Marketplace**, find the plugin, and click **Install**.
- **Cursor:** add this repository as a team marketplace, then install the plugin.
- **Claude Code:** `/plugin marketplace add syncfusion/BoldCreate-Plugins`, then `/plugin install <name>@boldcreate-plugins`.

Secrets such as API keys are never stored in this repository. Each MCP plugin declares them as install-time variables, and you enter them when you install it. See each plugin's README for setup.

## Syncfusion plugins

| `name` | Plugin | Category | `description` (from marketplace) |
|:-------|:-------|:---------|:-------------------------------------|
| `boldcreate-toolkit` | [BoldCreate Toolkit](boldcreate-toolkit/) | Developer Tools | Skills, reviewer agents and rules that take any project from idea to release: specs, test-first builds, two-axis code review and pull requests. |

## Syncfusion skill packs

The platform and SDK skill packs listed on [ai.syncfusion.com](https://ai.syncfusion.com/): UI component packs in `syncfusion/component-skills/`, document SDK packs in `syncfusion/sdk-skills/`, and the Xamarin migration pack in `syncfusion/migration-skills/`. Each pack keeps its skills as published in its source repository, except that links pointing outside a skill's own folder are removed; the `upstream` entry in `boldcreate.json` records the commit.

## Contributing

1. Edit the source files: `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, `boldcreate.json`, `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`, plus `mcp.json` for an MCP plugin or the skills, agents, rules and hooks for a Syncfusion plugin. Don't edit generated files by hand.
2. Run `npm ci`, then `npm run build` and `npm run validate`. Community plugins and Syncfusion skill packs are checked only for loadable components and an `upstream` entry in `boldcreate.json`. Validation also checks Syncfusion plugins against their context budgets: auto-skill descriptions, agent descriptions and always-on rules under 600 tokens, each `SKILL.md` at most 150 lines, each agent file at most 80 lines, and a scenario file for every skill.
3. Open a pull request. CI runs the same checks and the Claude Code plugin validator.
