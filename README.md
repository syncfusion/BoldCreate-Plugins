# Syncfusion BoldCreate Plugins

Syncfusion's BoldCreate plugins for BoldCreate Connect, Cursor and Claude Code. This branch holds only the toolkit:

- **Syncfusion plugins** at the repository root, made of skills, agents and rules. `boldcreate-toolkit/` gives agents one software delivery lifecycle on any stack.

## Install

- **BoldCreate Connect:** open **Marketplace**, find the plugin, and click **Install**.
- **Cursor:** add this repository as a team marketplace, then install the plugin.
- **Claude Code:** `/plugin marketplace add syncfusion/BoldCreate-Plugins`, then `/plugin install <name>@boldcreate-plugins`.

## Syncfusion plugins

| `name` | Plugin | Category | `description` (from marketplace) |
|:-------|:-------|:---------|:-------------------------------------|
| `boldcreate-toolkit` | [BoldCreate Toolkit](boldcreate-toolkit/) | Developer Tools | Skills, reviewer agents and rules that take any project from idea to release: specs, test-first builds, two-axis code review and pull requests. |

## Repository structure

This is a multi-plugin marketplace repository. The root marketplace files list every plugin, and each plugin has a manifest per client:

## Contributing

1. Edit the source files: `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, `boldcreate.json`, `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` and the skills, agents, rules and hooks. Don't edit generated files by hand.
2. Run `npm ci`, then `npm run build` and `npm run validate`. Validation also checks Syncfusion plugins against their context budgets: auto-skill descriptions, agent descriptions and always-on rules under 600 tokens, each `SKILL.md` at most 150 lines, each agent file at most 80 lines, and a scenario file for every skill.
3. Open a pull request. CI runs the same checks and the Claude Code plugin validator.
